# Digital Lab Notebook Course Outline

This repo contains the outline and notes for the Digital Lab Notebook (DLN) course for [ResBaz Dunedin 2018](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/dunedin/).

This course is designed to introduce Git/GitHub, markdown, DLN, and idea of Open Science to people who have no prior knowledge of any computing/programming.

Please note that the idea/implementation of DLN using Git/GitHub and markdown comes from Josh Harris' excellent [demonstration of DLN](https://github.com/JoshuaHarris391/OSG_Eletronic_lab_Book_JH).


## What this course covers

This course will cover the following:
1. Creating a GitHub account and a repo
1. Process of Version Control with Git/GitHub
1. Markdown syntax
1. Making a functional DLN
1. Local Version Control using command line and Git

The above objectives/topics will be covered in the duration of the course (2.5 hours).

For a detailed description of the course content, see [course outline](course_outline.md).


## For Teachers of this Course

The course notes live in the directory [notes/](notes) in PDF, using LaTeX.
I've decided to create the notes in LaTeX, because it's cleaner and you can print the PDF (rather than flicking back-and-forth between windows on your screen).

In the future, I may create a markdown version.


## TODO

* Create a markdown version for people who want to just read it in the browser
